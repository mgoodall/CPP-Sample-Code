//LOOPS ARE FORMALLY KNOWN AS INTERATION

/*
The three types of bounds in a loop are:
         Data bounds:  loops keep reading input until there is nothing left to process
         Sentinel bounds:  loop that looks for a particular input to end or continue
         Limits bound:  loops that end when there is no goal reached. It examines the result of the loop

CONTINUE AND BREAK:
A continue is used to not process the current loop iteration.. skip over it  BUT KEEP LOOPING.  For example, looping through numbers, skip every number evenly divisible by 5.
A break is used to end a loop early.  For example, when searching through data for a  word, exit the loop when the word is found, instead of continuing to loop to the end

//DECLARE AND INITIALIZE OUTSIDE LOOP! SCOPE IS VERY IMPORTANT
//F0R LOOP COUNTS UP, (OR DOWN)
for (int i=0; i<10, i++){  
 //  Precondition i =0, bounds i <10, post condition i++)
            	//do something here while repeating
}

//WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE
//WHILE LOOP WILL TEST TO SEE IF IT EVEN NEEDS TO RUN
//MAY NEED TO RESET A VARIABLE AT THE END OF A WHILE LOOP
int userChoice=1;  //precondition
while (userChoice !=6) { //bounds
            	//doing something here while eventually result in post-condition to end the loop
}

//NEVER WHILE (TRUE) - BAD AND LAZY CODING.  FORCES AN INFINITE LOOP. USEFUL FOR GRAPHICAL PROGRAMS ONLY

//DO WHILE LOOP
//THIS LOOP WILL ALWAYS RUN AT LEAST ONCE.  THINK MENU :)
//SOMETIMES MAY NEED TO RESET A VARIABLE AT THE END OF A WHILE LOOP
int userChoice=1;  //precondition
do {
            	//doing something here while eventually result in post-condition to end the loop
